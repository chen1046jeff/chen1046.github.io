            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> &nbsp <strong>Hello</strong> everyone, my name is <em>Guanxue Chen</em>. You can also call me <em>Jeff</em> or <abbr title="Jeff Chen">JC</abbr>.  And my birthday is April <sup>15</sup>, 2006.</p>

            <p> &nbsp I have <em>three</em> hobbies: <mark>cooking</mark>, <mark>photography</mark>, <mark>visual art</mark>. I like to make <em>pumpkin pancake</em> and <em>Chinese food</em>, <em>vegetable salad</em> is also my favourite. <abbr title="By the way">Btw</abbr> I don't like <del>spicy</del>. I like to use my <em>camera</em> to record the beautiful moments in my life. For me <em>drawing</em> is also a good way to relax from pleasure, this year I drew a <em>pencil sketch</em> for my dog on his birthday. </p>


            <p> &nbsp One of my famous <strong>motivational quote</strong> was from the movie call <em>Green Book</em>. <strong>Whatever you do, do it one hundred precent.</strong> When you <strong>work</strong>, you <astrong>work</strong>. When you <strong>laugh</strong>, you <strong>laugh</strong>. When you <strong>eat</strong>, eat like it's your <strong>last meal</strong>. It taught me to <em>give my all</em> in everything I do. It'll make my life more <em>meaningfull</em>.</p>
