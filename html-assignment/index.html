            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Hello</strong> everyone, my name is <em>Guanxue Chen</em>. You can also call me <em>Jeff</em>.  And my birthday is April <sup>15</sup>, 2006.</p>

            <p>I have <em>three</em> hobbies: <mark>cooking</mark>, <mark>photography</mark>, <mark>visual art</mark>. I like to make <abbr>pumpkin pancake</abbr> and <abbr>Chinese food</abbr>, <abbr>vegetable salad</abbr> is also my favourite. I like to use my <em>camera</em> to record the beautiful moments in my life. To myself <em>drawing</em> is also a good way to relax from pleasure, this year I drew a <abbr>pencil sketch</abbr> for my dog on his birthday. </p>


            <p>One of my famous <strong>motivational quote</strong> was from the movie call <em>Green Book</em>. <strong>Whatever you do, do it one hundred precent.</strong> When you <abbr>work</abbr>, you <abbr>work</abbr>. When you <abbr>laugh</abbr>, you <abbr>laugh</abbr>. When you <abbr>eat</abbr>, eat like it's your <abbr>last meal</abbr>. It taught me to <em>give my all</em> in everything I do. It'll make my life more <em>meaningfull</em>.</p>
